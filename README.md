# Classifying-Exoplanet-Subclasses-with-ML
This notebook utilizes the NASA Exoplanet Archive datasets to classify exoplanet subclasses by means of traditional machine learning algorithms and neural networks. The study performed explores the abilities of planetray features excluding mass and radius to be meaningful determinants in the classification of exoplanets into two subclasses; gas giants and rocky planets. Both Random Forest and Keras sequential models were implemented to test our hypothesis. Later, metrics including accuracy, precision, F1 score, and confusion matricies were utilized to analyze the results of our models and make conclusions regarding our study.
